title:  "Algorithms hijaking our attention"

Algorithms destroying fabric of our society.

People have one flaw anger is stickier than compassion, thus algorithms creating condition to generate as much rage as possible to keep peopls attention.

All "social" apps designed that way.

POint of big tech is to build model for each "user" and it's connection so that it can predict what do you want next moment, sometimes those model are so good that they can predict that person is about to look for something without that person explicitly mentioning it or searching it, they just mentioned to one friend in a conversaion is this my device listening.

Kids of tech designers banned from having phones and spending time with devices.

Applications are built in a way to maximally capture our attention, because that's what being sold, business model is more people spending time on the app more money those organizations make.

Tech giant shifting blame onto people themselves, saying that people didn't do anything to prevent this from happening, even though they "build" those nice features to prevent distraction.
