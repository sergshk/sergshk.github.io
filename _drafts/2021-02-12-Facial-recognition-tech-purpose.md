title:  "What is real purpose of facial recognition technology?"
---
I think that facial recognition technology has no real purpose, I can't think of anything about that technology that  could create social good. Image recognition as a field indeed you can be useful, for example in medicine to detect anomalies, but there is no social purpose for facial recognition technology. The only real purpose and biggest secret that big tech trying to hide is that such technology is only useful for surveillance and oppression. <!--more-->

Tech companies invested billions into those technologies, they are doing their best to appear useful, money has been already spent and it's time to report back to their shareholders on return on such investments. They sell this vision to consumers, they sell it to corporations and everyone in between. Consumers are fed with lies that it will make it easier to find photos of a person by tagging them in "your" photo archive, it will make it easier to unlock your phone, you don't need that airplane ticket to board and so on. 
For ages big tech has been talking about usefullness and supposedly social good, 
I know it sounds quite cheesy from a guy in technology and AI but hear me out. Over the years big tech companies were trying to prove that such technology is really useful it
