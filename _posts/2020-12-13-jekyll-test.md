Today I have decided to try new way of bloggin, it's GitHub pages, that use jekyll behing the scene to generate content.
After reading some documentation and hacking couple examples togethr, I've decided to mvoe my entire blog to Jekyll for simplicity. It's way simpler than using whole fledged platforms like Blogpost, all you need is internet and console to write your content.
